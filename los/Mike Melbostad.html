			<span class="strong">Mike's Bio</span>
			<p>As a loan officer I use my knowledge and experience to find the best opportunities for my clients. I take pride in understanding the micro and macro events and how they relate to the mortgage industry, and how those events can affect your financing terms.<br>
As a true a client advocate I take the time to tailor the right loan program to your needs. Whether that is FHA, VA, USDA, or just your standard conforming loan I will help you find what is the best fit for you. I also guarantee to be upfront and let you know if my deal is really the correct option for your situation. I spend my time trying to reduce your cost of homeownership rather than maximizing my profit margins.<br>
Many loan officers take the path of least resistance rather than finding the program option and loan structure that provides the most benefit, and that method typically fails their clients. I develop lifetime relationships with my clients by focusing on what is right for them, not what is simplest for me.<br>
