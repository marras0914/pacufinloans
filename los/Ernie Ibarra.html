			<span class="strong">About Me</span>
			<p>When you’re 14 years old, getting up at 6:00 a.m. every day – rain or shine, snow or sleet – isn’t always the easiest thing to do. But as a paperboy, getting those papers to the customers on my route was so important to me that I did it anyway, every day of the week - and I always delivered on time.<br><br>
That strong work ethic, with a commitment to customer service, attention to detail, professional courtesy and reliability, has guided my professional life - from my first job as a paperboy, to my customer service position at our family retail flower shop, to 6 years as a United State Marine, and through more than 8 years running my own business. Though the job titles have varied, the underlying dedication remains the same: I provide the best possible customer service to my clients, no matter what.<br><br>
To me, customer service boils down to one simple rule: to always treat others the way I want to be treated. So, when you are my client, expect to be treated with respect and courtesy. Above all else, I am a professional...and I will use my years of knowledge and experience to find the best loan program for your needs. After all, your home represents one of - if not the - largest purchases you’ll ever make. Such a significant investment of your resources, finances and time is not something you want to mess around with. My no-nonsense approach means I will use all the knowledge and resources at my disposal to get your deal done in a timely, smooth and stress-free manner, and communicate with you during the entire process. I’m an up-front, to-the-point Mortgage Loan Officer, which means my clients get important updates as soon as I get them!<br><br>
My professional work ethic stems in large part from my background and upbringing. I learned the value of commitment, service and dedication at a young age. Today, I love working with veterans and their families, upholding my core values of "Honor – Courage – Commitment". It’s extremely rewarding to me to help members of our military purchase the perfect home for their needs.<br><br>
I pride myself on providing the best possible customer service to all of my clients, whether they’re new homebuyers or seasoned investors. My current and previous customers will tell you that I am courteous, knowledgeable and a great communicator.<br><br>
When it comes down to it, the jobs I’ve held throughout my life – from a paperboy, to a Marine and now as a licensed mortgage professional – may seem different on the surface, but they all boil down to commitment to customer service. I welcome the opportunity to assist you in exploring the best loan for you.<br><br>
