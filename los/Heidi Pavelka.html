			<span class="strong">About Me</span>
			<p>My experience in Mortgage Origination has created strengths in business development, production, management, motivational speaking and coaching has cultivated me into the dedicated and driven originator that I am today. Whether it's providing customers with financial solutions or collaborating with my business to business referral partners, it allows me to focus on building lasting relationships through trust, integrity and honest advice.</p>
<p>With more than 19 successful years in the mortgage industry, I take pride in the many lasting relationships I have built within my mortgage business. By asking important questions and listening to what is most important to their family and financial goals. With that information, I can create a plan that best fits their needs.</p>
<p>One of my strengths is that I am readily available for my customers throughout the entire financing process, which has resulted in the ability to successfully help people in unique and challenging situations. This steadfast commitment to always working in my customers' best interests allows me to work by referral. "The foundation of my business is always to have a give-and-grow gratitude attitude..."</p>
<p>A perfect referral for me is: first-time homebuyers, move-up buyers, refinance transactions and customers who are looking to purchase investment properties. For personalized mortgage guidance and exceptional customer service, contact Heidi at 612-LOAN-007 or <a href="mailto:heidi@heidipavelka.com">heidi@heidipavelka.com</a></p>
