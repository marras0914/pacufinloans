			<span class="strong">About Me</span>
			<p>Hi, my name is Douglas Smith and I am a licensed Mortgage Originator for Louisiana and Mississippi. I was born in Natchez, MS, a town with southern charm situated along the mighty Mississippi River and well known for the historic Natchez Trace. After graduating from Natchez High School, I received an Associate Degree from Copiah-Lincoln Community College. Then I attended The University of Mississippi School of Business Administration for a year before earning a Bachelor of History at the University of Southern Mississippi. Following college, I began my career in banking with Trustmark Bank. A few years later I moved to AmSouth Bank, which is now Regions Bank.</p><p style="margin-top:5px;">With almost 15 years in banking, I am very excited to be in the mortgage lending industry. I understand my customers’ needs to not only get the greatest rates possible, but to also work with a mortgage specialist who helps make the process as convenient and straightforward as possible. As a Loan Officer with Pacific Union Financial, I strive to go the extra mile for every customer – from those buying their first home, to those refinancing their current mortgage. Having the ability to offer customers loan options means we can work together to find the right mortgage solution that best meets your financial situation and goals.</p><p style="margin-top:5px;">Outside of work, I am a committee member for Cub Scouts Pack 131 in Dutchtown, LA. Being an Eagle Scout myself, it’s a chance for me to give back and teach these young men about camping and being good citizens in our community. Other activities I enjoy include SEC college football, exercising, fishing and hunting.<br>Contact me today for additional information or to discuss your specific mortgage needs!</p>

			<span class="strong">My Pledge To My Customers</span><br>
			<p>I will offer one-on-one attention to each and every customer in a no-pressure, no-obligation environment.  I will listen to every detail of their goals of home ownership.  And I will work hard to find the mortgage solution that best suits their financial situation.</p>
