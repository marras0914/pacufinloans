				<p>With many years of experience in the mortgage industry, and extensive practice in originating home loans for both purchase and refinance, I am a firm believer in excellent customer service and offering the most competitive pricing.
I have continued to be one of the most knowledgeable Mortgage Loan Officers in Southern California.<br>
During my 12 years of experience in the mortgage industry, I have shared my expertise to personally assist hundreds of families with responsible and affordable home financing. I have an extensive background assisting first time homebuyers, high net worth borrowers, low-to-moderate income borrowers, self-employed borrowers, investment borrowers and our local heroes: Police, Firefighters, Teachers and Medical workers.
Please contact me for answers to any of your home financing questions. I would be more than happy to offer my professional knowledge.</p>
