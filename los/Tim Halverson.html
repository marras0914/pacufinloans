			<span class="strong">About Me</span>
			<p>I have been a leader in the mortgage industry for over 24 years, dedicating a good part of my career helping to improve the mortgage industry, being a Legislative Chair, and Past Executive Director with the California Association of Mortgage Brokers. I also lead a committee on Ethics in Advertising where we worked directly with the Department of Real Estate to clamp down on misleading and illegal advertising.</p>  
<p>My approach to this business has always been working with honesty and integrity to educate my clients on what is the right mortgage to fit their needs. I work directly with my clients to get the right program, with the best rate and fee structure available.  I have provided the $50,000 condo loan, and the $1 million plus home loan and everything in between. My goal is to put the same exceptional effort into every loan I provide, regardless of loan size. I value every client I have.</p>
